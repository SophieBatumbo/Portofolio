# Portofolio

Welcome on a presentation about all you should know about me to collaborate.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Update github page

# Frist Step

# Second and last step
Run in your command line `./deploy.sh`

OR

run `ng build --output-path docs --base-href /Portofolio/`. Then, from 'docs/browser' folder, move all the content of 'browser' folder into 'docs' folder. Delete empty 'browser' folder. Add commit and push.

That's all hihi
